# MoveMouseDesktop
- Multi-platform Python application that moves the mouse every 20 seconds.
- Prevent your screen from locking and keeping your work chats online

- Useful when you don't want your computer to lock itself and stay online on Slack/Teams/etc while you sleep until 10:30 AM when working from home

## Usage
- When you run it, the mouse moves, preventing your screen from being locked.
- While running, a mouse icon is displayed in the tray bar.
- If you press "q" the application quits.
- It has an "about" option where you can see a ridiculous photo of me programming, as well as the link to the repository.

### That's it.-
